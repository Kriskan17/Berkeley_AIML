What drives the price of a car?


# OVERVIEW

In this application, we explored a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

# CRISP-DM Framework
To frame the task, throughout our practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM here. After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

# Business Understanding
From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices. In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition. Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.

The following steps were taken to analyse the used car data
Data Understanding
Data Prep
Modelling
Evaluation


# Findings: The following are the important findings of this review : 



This plot shows the importance of each feature in the data set , The 3 important features that drive the car price are

Year of manufacture
The number of cylinders in the car
Transmission
The other features that are about same importance are

Paint color
Car type (van, suv, sedan, cuv etc)
Manufacturer
Condition
It is suprising to see that the fuel type and odometer mileage are not a significant factors in determing the price of the car.
