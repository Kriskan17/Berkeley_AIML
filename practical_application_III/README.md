What drives the price of a car?


# OVERVIEW

In this application, we explored a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

# CRISP-DM Framework
To frame the task, throughout our practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM here. After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

# Business Understanding
From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices. In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition. Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.

The following steps were taken to analyse the used car data
Data Understanding
Data Prep
Modelling
Evaluation


# Findings: The following are the important findings of this review : 


# Recommendations :
* Appropriate Timing: The timing of the marketing campaign during the year is important. The campaigns ran duing the months of March, August and May are more likely to enrol customers to the program.

* Economy : The external financial factors like High employment rate (emp.var.rate), Better CPI (Consumer price index ), euribor (3 month interest rate) are also important factors to consider.

* Duration and Previous Campaign : Duration of the call and Previous outcome may not be good indicators, as the duration of the call may just mean the people who enrolled actually spend more time to complete the enrollment process.
